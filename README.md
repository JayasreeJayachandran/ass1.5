1.The main sources of Data flood:
 There are various sources for data flood,mainly
   1.internaet plays a major role in data flooding numerous website such as youtube,mail,facebook,etc.
   2.stock exchanges,
   3.social websites,
   4.astrononmy,
   5.medical details,
   6.spam mails,
   7.genetic information.
2.Difference between Data and Big data.
Data: Being a very generic term "Data",is just raw facts which can be unstructured and structured data, Data Science is a field that 
comprises of everything that we do with the data i.e, conversion into information, storage and analysis.
-Very hard to analyze with traditional techniques. 
-Comparatively decision made is less accurate.
-Cost of scaling is high and hard.
Big Data: Big Data refers to huge volumes of data that cannot be processed effectively with the traditional applications that exist. 
Big Data is something that can be used to analyze insights which can lead to 
-Easy to analyze as a framework does the job for you.
-better decision and strategic business moves.
-Cost to scaling is cheap and easy.
-Managing is done by the framework(e.g hadoop)
3.Major complexities of data explosion are:
1.Storage Problem-hadoop overcomes this by using multiple systems(HDFS) for storing data instead of scaling vertically on a single instance.
2.Analyzing: Hadoop uses a technique called MapReduce for processing the distributed data.
Major complexities of Horizontal scaling:
1.Hardware problems: Hadoop has data redundancy for handling system failures and fast processing.
2.Management problems: Hadoop handles all the systems in the distributed system, turning them off/on and 
maintaining them to get best results.
